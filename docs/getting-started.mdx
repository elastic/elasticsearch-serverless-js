This page guides you through the installation process of the Serverless Node.js 
client, shows you how to instantiate the client, and how to perform basic 
Elasticsearch operations with it.

## Requirements

* Node.js 16 or higher installed on your system.

## Installation

### Using the command line

You can install the Elasticsearch Serverless Node.js client with the following 
commands:

```bash
npm install @elastic/elasticsearch-serverless
```

## Instantiate a client

You can instantiate a client by running the following command:

```js
const { Client } = require('@elastic/elasticsearch-serverless')
const client = new Client({
  cloud: { id: '<cloud-id>' },
  auth: { apiKey: 'base64EncodedKey' }
})
```

You can find the Elasticsearch endpoint on the Cloud deployment management page.

You can create a new API Key under **Stack Management** > **Security**:

## Using the API

After you instantiate a client with your API key and Elasticsearch endpoint, you 
can start ingesting documents into the Elasticsearch Service. You can use the 
Bulk API for this. This API enables you to index, update, and delete several 
documents in one request.

### Creating an index and ingesting documents

You can call the `bulk` helper API with a list of documents and a handler for 
what action to perform on each handler. 

The following is an example of bulk indexing some classic books into the `books` 
index:

```js
// First we build our data:
const body = [
  {name: "Snow Crash", "author": "Neal Stephenson", "release_date": "1992-06-01", "page_count": 470},
  {name: "Revelation Space", "author": "Alastair Reynolds", "release_date": "2000-03-15", "page_count": 585},
  {name: "1984", "author": "George Orwell", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 328},
  {name: "Fahrenheit 451", "author": "Ray Bradbury", "release_date": "1953-10-15", "page_count": 227},
  {name: "Brave New World", "author": "Aldous Huxley", "release_date": "1932-06-01", "page_count": 268},
  {name: "The Handmaid's Tale", "author": "Margaret Atwood", "release_date": "1985-06-01", "page_count": 311}
]

// Then we send the data using the bulk API helper:
const result = await client.helpers.bulk({
  datasource: body,
  onDocument (doc) {
    // instructs the bulk indexer to add each item in `body` to the books index
    // you can optionally inspect each `doc` object to alter what action is performed per document
    return {
      index: { _index: 'books' }
    }
  }
})
```

### Searching

Now that some data is available, you can search your documents using the 
**Search API**:

```js
const result = await client.search({
  index: 'books',
  query: {
    match: {
      author: 'Ray Bradbury'
    }
  }
})
console.log(result.hits.hits)
```

## TypeScript

The Node.js client is implemented in TypeScript, so any IDEs supporting 
TypeScript-based autocompletion should automatically find and load the 
appropriate declaration files in the package's `lib` directory.
The source TypeScript can also be 
[viewed on GitHub](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-serverless-js/tree/main/src).
